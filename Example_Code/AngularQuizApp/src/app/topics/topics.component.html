      <h5 class="card-title">Brexit</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Brexit, eh. That really dragged on, didn't it? After a lot of to and fro, delays, buses and more, the UK eventually left the bloc. For good or for worse? Who knows. Over what felt like a lifetime, there was a lot of misinformation surrounding Brexit; can you distinguish between what was true, and what isn't?</p>

      <p class="card-text">Coronavirus cancelled 2020, a year many earmarked as their best one yet... New year, new me! As well as ruining the Euros, COVID-19 was a catalyst for increased gaslighting and caused divisions between the inhabitants of earth due to a fair share of fake news and downright outrageous claims. But, can you tell what's what?</p>

What we do know, however, is that climate change is most certainly real (looking at you, Donald), and it is going to spoil the party if we, as a planet, are not careful with our actions. Misinformation is rife, with many senior folk not accepting the facts and plenty of interesting characters sharing interesting "news"...</p>
