Johnson spoke to the Queen on Wednesday to request an end to the current Parliament session in September. The shift gives opposition lawmakers less time to block a no-deal Brexit before the U.K.'s Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has asked to meet the Queen to block the move, and vowed to do 'everything we can to stop Boris Johnson's smash and grab against our democracy.''",
