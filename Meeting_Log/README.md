Survey Monkey Summary:
- Name is OK

Meeting 11.03.2021

-Properly outlined and formatted README file on github landing page.
	-Took time to discuss a roadmap (e.g. Reading week a good time for first sprint??)
-Discussed market research and how useful it could be to make the project as effective as possible.
	-For Background and motivations.
	-To potentially find new ideas.
-Discussion in 'Thursday' channel:
	-Potentially having another single page app to display where data was coming from
	-Using a static database O.K.
	-For testing and incase we don't find a suitable enough dataset.
-Discussion with Tom Bale:
	-Tracking user progress
	-Can do it, but could be very difficult
	-Can use 3rd party authenticators for this
	-May have to pay for these 3rd party authenticator
	-Doing it ourselves could be tricky.
	-Options:
		>Use the 'session'
		>Browser is handling and executing the code
		>Can hold variables and arrays etc. which doesnt change locally
		>To use for a leaderboard perhaps
		>Could set timeouts to longer to perhaps hold this info? [Probably not as effective]
		>Use a resume 'code' to store user data?
		*SUMMARISE*:
		-Hardcore method of doing it all yourself.
		-Use 3rd party authenticator.
		-Use resume codes.
		-Use session data.

		>Probably a JS 'Quiz' framerwork we can use.
		>Tom urged to try things asap and learn from doing.
		>Early Implementation and testing is key.
-Organised to commit the Angular Dashboard, Design Choices directory and Meeting Log (Obviously).
