Objectives of meeting :
-> Start thinking about the construction of our static DB 
-> Start with ER model - list attributes, relationships etc 
-> Construct list of sources 
-> Think about how to integrate with API? -> store as CSV, use SQL? 

Made basic ER Diagram for backend work.
Consolidate with front end members to where we can incorporate images via a Fake News link.
As another team-member to check the ER diagram, probably via a pull request.
Made decisions regarding dependencies and uses of articles in terms of quiz questions.

For next session:
