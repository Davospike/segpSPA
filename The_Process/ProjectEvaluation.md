**Code of ethics** 

We decided to investigate the ethical implications of delivering this project through the lens of normative ethics. The framework we opted for is adapted from the 

[DIODE framework,]: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220173139_Ethical_assessment_of_new_technologies_A_meta-methodology

 which is used to assess new technologies. The procedure for this type of analysis involves highlighting a possible ethical issue and considering its alternatives from three ethical perspectives: Consequentialist, Deontic and Virtue. For the purpose of this project, we considered Consequentialist perspectives in terms of the possible outcomes to stakeholders, Deontic in terms of rules and legality. For the values based ethics, we set out our own company ethical principles that we aspire to in our daily work. These comprise:

- Respect for others
- Integrity and honesty
- Justice
- Lawfulness
- Competence and accountability
- Teamwork

With this framework in place, we sat down together for an ethical workshop and ruminated on the ethical issues of developing the Would They Lie To You? quiz. We underscored the importance of talking through this debate as a group in order to bring as many perspectives and opinions to the table as possible. The considerations and outcomes of our workshop are below:

**Data privacy** 

We discussed data privacy as the pertinent ethical issue concerning this project. We first identified the stakeholders as our users and considered potential outcomes of holding their data.  During this process, we amassed a series of questions that we thought would be important to investigate, including: Would we be prepared for a data breach? Would we be able to ensure the privacy and security of our users' data? Would we have the right mechanisms in place to destroy or delete data if requested to do so? Due to the nature of our social-political quiz topics and the theme of fake news, user data that we collect by way of the quiz could be sensitive. For example, the responses a user inputs into the quiz could reveal an apparent alignment accord with racist stereotypes or prejudices relating to Brexit. It is plausible that this data could be harmful or libellous if publicised.   

Having considered the data privacy of our users
