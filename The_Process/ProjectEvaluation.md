**Code of ethics** 

We decided to investigate the ethical implications of delivering this project through the lens of normative ethics. The framework we opted for is adapted from the [DIODE framework](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220173139_Ethical_assessment_of_new_technologies_A_meta-methodology ), which is used to assess new technologies. The procedure for this type of analysis involves highlighting a possible ethical issue and considering its alternatives from three ethical perspectives: Consequentialist, Deontic and Virtue. For the purpose of this project, we considered Consequentialist perspectives in terms of the possible outcomes to stakeholders, Deontic in terms of rules and legality. For the values based ethics, we set out our own company ethical principles that we aspire to in our daily work. These comprise:

- Respect for others
- Integrity and honesty
- Justice
- Lawfulness
- Competence and accountability
- Teamwork

With this framework in place, we sat down together for an ethical workshop and ruminated on the ethical issues of developing the Would They Lie To You? quiz. We underscored the importance of talking through this debate as a group in order to bring as many perspectives and opinions to the table as possible. The considerations and outcomes of our workshop are below:

**Data privacy** 

We discussed data privacy as the pertinent ethical issue concerning this project. We first identified the stakeholders as our users and considered potential outcomes of holding their data.  During this process, we amassed a series of questions that we thought would be important to investigate, including: Would we be prepared for a data breach? Would we be able to ensure the privacy and security of our users' data? Would we have the right mechanisms in place to destroy or delete data if requested to do so? Due to the nature of our social-political quiz topics and the theme of fake news, user data that we collect by way of the quiz could be sensitive. For example, the responses a user inputs into the quiz could reveal an apparent alignment accord with racist stereotypes or prejudices relating to Brexit. It is plausible that this data could be harmful or libellous if publicised. Given that this is the first application that we have built together, we may not be able to build a system with adequate security to house this sensitive data. 

Next, we considered the ethical issue of data privacy in terms of its legality. We consulted the UK's [Data Protection Act 2018](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-protection-act-2018) to inform this discussion, which clearly states 'everyone responsible for using personal data' must ensure, among other things, that it is handled with appropriate security, including protection against loss, destruction or damage. 



This Consequentialist perspective directly impacted our thinking for the design of our website. Instead of including a username and a login, which would enable the collection of user-specific data, we decided to
