**Code of ethics** 

We decided to investigate the ethical implications of delivering this project through the lens of normative ethics. The framework we opted for is adapted from the 

[DIODE framework,]: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220173139_Ethical_assessment_of_new_technologies_A_meta-methodology

 which is used to assess new technologies. The procedure for this type of analysis involves highlighting a possible ethical issue and considering its alternatives from three ethical perspectives: Consequentialist, Deontic and Virtue. For the purpose of this project, we considered Consequentialist perspectives in terms of the possible outcomes to stakeholders, Deontic in terms of rules and legality. For the values based ethics, we set out our own company ethical principles that we aspire to in our daily work. These comprise:

- Respect for others
- Integrity and honesty
- Justice
- Lawfulness
- Competence and accountability
- Teamwork

With this framework in place, we sat down together for an ethical workshop and ruminated on the ethical issues of developing the Would They Lie To You? quiz. We underscored the importance of talking through this debate as a group in order to bring as many perspectives and opinions to the table as possible. The considerations and outcomes of our workshop are below:
