## Software Development Process
A software development process can be seen as the application of divide and conquer whereby the development process is divided into smaller, parallel steps or subprocesses. Doing so helps improve the design and management of a project. Given that we, as university students, had other commitments and modules, we were aware that we would have to manage the project development in a flexible manner, and in a fixed amount of time. Unlike in the professional world, we could not get extensions. 

Due to these constraints, we first sought out a strategy to apply to our work approach. We knew little and often be beneficial, ensuring a smoother journey towards a minimal viable product. For that reason we set out to compare and contrast the industry standard software development life cycle methods in order to find our approach.

[ADD TO] - Stuff on "Discussion of team roles (specialisation is ok!). A summary of individual contributions (note: this is for reference, your team will all receive the same grade!)."  OR this goes in conclusion/evaluation? 12.03.21 meeting

### Software Development Life Cycle
[ADD TO/REMOVE] - Discuss SDLC framework/ideas etc. 

### Agile
[ADD TO] - Discuss agile and benefits vs Waterfall and why we chose it.
[ADD TO] - Group working methods used (for instance did your team choose a particular style of agile? what communication channels did you use?)

### GitHub Continuous Integration
[ADD TO] - Stuff on "Team use of Git, how your team used continuous integration / continuous deployment. Streamlining of workflow throughout."

## Sprints
[MARK SCHEME] - Documentation of your sprints, including both high level overview, timeline, and selected highlights that were critical points in the project (remember to show the users stories implemented in each sprint). We expect a summary of meeting logs (including for instance apologies for absence etc)

### Sprint 1 : Webpage Design & Initial Feedback (01.03.21-07.03.21) 
During this week we had a reading week and a break from new content on our modules. We used this as an opportunity to come together to have our first sprint. 

The goals of the first sprint were as follows:
- Come together and brainstorm an initial webpage design.
- Develop a paper prototype design of what we thought our Fake News quiz could look like (to read more about our design processes and ideation, please see the [System Design page](The_Process/SystemDesign.md)).
- Generate a SurveyMonkey feedback questionaire for our paper prototype (see here).
- Familiarise ourselves with GitHub and continuous integration best practises.
- Amalgamate some potential datasets.

Due to the early nature of this sprint, it was heavily focussed on coming up with an initial website design and converting this into a paper prototype so that we could present it to friends and family for early stage feedback. During the design session we brainstormed ideas about what we thought made a quiz engaging and interactive. Given todays day and age, the trend for website seems to be a quite refined, simplistic design, and we thought that the same would apply for a quiz. Having loud, in your face pages can be distracting and take away from the message/aim of the page. Further discussions centred around what other successful websites with quizzes had done and we spoke about what works well about these webpages (e.g. Gapminder). 

Using the takeaways from the design sessions, we were able to develop a paper prototype and relevant questions based off this paper prototype. We had all agreed early user feedback would be beneficial for creating a minimum viable product that works well and is aesthetically pleasing.

Allowing time in this sprint to play around with GitHub also proved beneficial to hit the ground running on the documentation of the project, especially as we had little-to-no experience with it prior to this course. And thinking about and pulling together some potential data sets we saw as a good idea in order to help with the technical side of things further down the line.

### No Sprints : Continue Working on Workbooks (08.03.21-21.03.21)
During this time we worked on other university commitments whilst continuing to follow along with the Software Engineering workbooks and lectures, all the while meeting up to take note of ideas, thoughts and design conceptualization.

### Sprint 2 : Market Research & Deploying Boilerplate (22.03.21-28.03.21)
The second sprint was a brief, achievable sprint that coincided with the last workbook that was required to fully deploy the boilerplate Angular dashboard. We also used this sprint as an opportunity to carry out some market research before the start of the Easter break, where we had foreplanned to have 3 substaintial sprints. Carrying out this market research prior to the break meant that we could go into the forthcoming sprints with fresh ideas for the next round of feedback, wire frame design and building out the webpage.

Key goals:
- Have all team members individually successfully finish boilerplate deployment workbook.
- Upload a complete boilerplate dashboard to GitHub repo for further development.
- Carry out more substantial market research.

As this was also deadline week for another assignment, this sprint was deliberately brief, but was decided with good intentions. Having all teams members at the same level of understanding, regarding the full stack deployment, going into 3 weeks of sprints where we expected to achieve a lot, in terms of advancing the front and backend, would be hugely beneficial. With everyone at the same level, it would mean that if additional resources were required at either end, we would be able to pivot and share the load better amongsts ourselves. Further, with a fully working dashboard up on the GitHub repo, we would be in good stead to hit the ground running for further development on the quiz for the first sprint of Easter.

### Sprint 3 : Prepare Backend & Additional Wireframe (29.03.21-04.04.21)


## MEAN Stack System Implementation


### Stack Architecture & System Design
[ADD TO] - e.g. class diagrams, sequence diagrams. Might be best place/more detail in SystemDesign.md?

### Back End : MongoDB
[ADD TO] - database implementation, the data model that you developed your back end from (e.g. entity relationship diagrams).

### Middle Tier : Express, Node, RESTful API
[ADD TO] - No further markscheme notes.

### Front End : Angular
[ADD TO] - Details of implementation.

### Deployment
[ADD TO] - Deployment details (including Docker), include how you have been achieving continuous integration and deployment.

### Additional
[ADD TO] - Additional elements and components e.g. authentification. Tell us about any other aspects not covered above!
