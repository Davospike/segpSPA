## Software Development Process
A software development process can be seen as the application of divide and conquer whereby the development process is divided into smaller, parallel steps or subprocesses. Doing so helps improve the design and management of a project. Given that we, as university students, had other commitments and modules, we were aware that we would have to manage the project development in a flexible manner, and in a fixed amount of time. Unlike in the professional world, we could not get extensions. Due to these constraints, we first sought out a strategy to apply to our work approach. We knew little and often be beneficial, ensuring a smoother journey towards a minimal viable product. For that reason we set out to compare and contrast the industry standard software development life cycle methods in order to find our approach.

### Software Development Life Cycle
[ADD TO/REMOVE] Discuss SDLC framework/ideas etc. 

### Agile
[ADD TO] Discuss agile and benefits vs Waterfall and why we chose it.
