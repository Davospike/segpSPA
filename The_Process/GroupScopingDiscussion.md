## Conceptual Scope

Conceptually balance between serious and playful elements are quite even.

We are aiming to both raise awareness in the form of educational snippets/facts about fakes news and then provoke changes in attitudes with the quiz. If people think they are “woke” but do badly on the quiz/subconsciously think certain resources are reliable, when in fact they aren’t.

The primary objective is to develop an educational quiz that tasks users with identifying fake news.

Target audience/ Demographic: Focus on those that consume majority of their news from online resources/social media

- These are often riddled with fake news


## Technical Scope
Current focus with team resources is split between front end and back end relatively evenly

Identifying the importance of front-end – not making the quiz too difficult to navigate around; want a light, responsive application.

Back-end – Trying to avoid repeat questions and issues with formatting/the info displayed on screen, especially as we aim to include a body of text in the quiz question.

## Evaluation Scope

### Evaluation Methods:
- More user tests – survey, live navigation demo, part way through and “finished” product -> in user tests have some sample questions
- Booking in a meeting with Marcli/Allison
- Peer to peer meeting - backend evaluate front end design and vice versa
- Technical evaluation - conformity to normalisation of databases - referral to lectures from University Lecturers

### Evaluation Timing:
- Beginning paper prototype
- Throughout

### User feedback analysis:
- Catered front-end for user feedback from first survey

### Compare outcomes to initial objectives:
#### Primary goals:
- Develop an educational quiz, tasking users with identifying fake news 
- Use the webpage to inform users about the spread and danger of fake news 
- Create a static database that holds a handpicked selection of news articles that are identified as being fact or fiction
#### Stretch goals:
- Collect and store user data, such as their quiz score and where they obtain their news from 
- Create a login function for the site so users are encouraged to revisit 
- Create a function that allows users to share their score via twitter/facebook/other social media
