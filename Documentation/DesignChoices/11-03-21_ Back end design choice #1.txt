Made a decision revolving back end, specifically the database from which our RESTful API will be connecting to our SPA, after seeking feedback from lecturers in a live teams meeting. 

The main issues in focus:
-> since we had multiple data sets pulled from open-source resources (Kaggle), each with its own data model, we faced difficulty in trying to merge the datasets.
-> for our website to function for its "serious" purpose, it is imperative that the data we provide is correct, based on verified data models, and is also synchronous, whereby common terms are used to describe / identify fake news.
-> furthermore, in order to educate users on particular, current topics, which is one of our aims, we need to identify topics for each news item. A lot of the data sets are labelled with vague categories, i.e., "political news" which would not allow us to categorise in a way that is attractive to users.

One way we thought we could go about this is by scraping data and linking up other APIs with our database. This would allow us to potentially get refreshed, current data on news sources. However, we thought that this would leave us open to scrutiny from other data models, that are completely out of our control, if they fault. 

The alternative was creating a static database, from which we can pull individual data holistically from our library of data sets, and identify categories and adjust our data.


We sought out additional feedback from Stuart, Thomas, Peter, Allison (Joined live call on teams). Feedback:
-> make a decision based on what we want to focus on as a group - lean towards
-> data warehousing techniques, which would be needed to amalgamate the databases, are difficult to do and may not be that beneficial in light of the project 
-> a more viable solution may be to make a static database ourselves


Made the design choice to go with constructing a static database ourselves from a varied library of data sources.
