Objectives of meeting :
-> Start thinking about the construction of our static DB
-> Start with ER model - list attributes, relationships etc
-> Construct list of sources
-> Think about how to integrate with API? -> store as CSV, use SQL?

Made basic ER Diagram for backend work.
Consolidate with front end members to where we can incorporate images via a Fake News link.
As another team-member to check the ER diagram, probably via a pull request.
Made decisions regarding dependencies and uses of articles in terms of quiz questions.
Ambiguity regarding News items having multiple News topics
	-Would be good to utilise news info to declare a topic
	-and then tell the user what topic the news item is regarding

For next session:
	-review notes on normalisation
	-check it conforms to BCNF (for writing tables)
