Objectives of meeting :
-> Start thinking about the construction of our static DB
-> Start with ER model - list attributes, relationships etc
-> Construct list of sources
-> Think about how to integrate with API? -> store as CSV, use SQL?

Made basic ER Diagram for backend work.
Consolidate with front end members to where we can incorporate images via a Fake News link.
As another team-member to check the ER diagram, probably via a pull request.
Made decisions regarding dependencies and uses of articles in terms of quiz questions.
Ambiguity regarding News items having multiple News topics
	-Would be good to utilise news info to declare a topic
	-and then tell the user what topic the news item is regarding

For next session:
	-review notes on normalisation
	-check it conforms to BCNF (for writing tables)

Objectives of meeting:
-> check DB structure conforms to BCNF
-> start creating directory structure and input examples
-> decide on coherent list of datasets we will use

:::												:::
::: WHEN CREATING EXAMPLE .CSV FILE TO TEST ER DIAGRAM:						:::
:::												:::
:::-Realised that News_Item table would only be used to ask a Quiz Question			:::
:::-Therefore having a Quiz Question table is redundant.					:::
:::-Due to the 1 to 1 relationship between News Item and Quiz Question.				:::
:::--Solution: merge Quiz Question and News_Item						:::
:::												:::
:::-Even though in our original model, each question was going to be based on one news topic.	:::
:::-If we can, we would implement multiple news topics per question				:::
:::-Therefore we have left 'News Topic' as a separate table.					:::
:::												:::
:::-Researched about join tables, realised they don't necessarily need a PK			:::
:::-Removed PK from join table Topic_Library for clarity and ease of use.			:::
:::												:::
:::-Considered when we would store user follow up input						:::
:::-i.e when user is incorrect *then* they will be prompted with a follow up qu.		:::
:::-Need to consult with team (See 'for next session')						:::
:::												:::

-Updated ERDiagram considering changes made from .csv example
-Checked for normalisation in the backend layout (See '../DatabaseDesign/Normalisation_RunThrough.txt').
-Slight confusion between Composite/Non-composite candidate keys in terms of violating BCNF 2.
	-> checked notes and David's powerpoints to iron out this issue. (BCNF2 O.K now).

For next session:
	- add actual data to directory/mongoDB
	- consult with team when to program user follow-up questions 
	- hard to explain but 'is the follow up going to be triggered from the backend or the frontend.'
	- choose datasets and start filling in databses
		-> may have to change backend structure depending on dataset found
