Generally, the team focused on the Java assignment due in for this week, hence there was little to discuss concerning personal progress since the last meeting.

We booked a meeting on Wednesday, and have all agreed on some common goals to achieve before then.

* write up some more market research 
* catch up on all lectures missed 
* update the angular dashboard on git page 

On wednesday, want to discuss 

- meeting prep before technical meeting w/ Allison and Marceli - list of Qs we want to ask them 
- Formulate sprints for the week and integrate into gantt chart 
- discuss what next round of user feedback will look like (marcelapp.com??)
