Agenda:
- Discuss our progress made on the week 6 API development workbook;
- Review Survey Monkey responses to our Paper Prototype we sent out last week and note down any changes to be made; 
- Discuss role distribution (i.e. front vs backend assignment);
- Review previous project examples from GitHub.

Log:
Survey Monkey Summary:
- Name is OK
- Navigation seems OK
- Substantial negative feedback about the colour scheme 
- Appealed as interesting to users 
- Not a lot of users would suggest to a friend – add a social element, link to friend / social media account? 

Actions:
- Update colour scheme, add new page for just Fake News info/education
- New meeting for 12/03/2021 for final discussion on role distribution
- Achieve by easter state agreed - Aim to have landing page on webpage done and maybe some DB integration

Meeting 11.03.2021

- Started to properly outlined and formatted README file on github landing page.
- Took time to discuss a roadmap (e.g. Reading week a good time for first sprint??)
- Discussed market research and how useful it could be to make the project as effective as possible.
   - For Background and motivations.
   - To potentially find new ideas.
- Potentially having another single page app to display where data was coming from
   - Using a static database O.K.
   - For testing and incase we don't find a suitable enough dataset.
- Discussion with Tom Bale:
- Tracking user progress, can do it, but could be very difficult. Can use 3rd party authenticators for this; May have to pay for these 3rd party authenticator. Doing it ourselves could be tricky.
- Options:
   - Use the 'session'; browser is handling and executing the code
   - Can hold variables and arrays etc. which doesnt change locally
   - To use for a leaderboard perhaps
   - Could set timeouts to longer to perhaps hold this info? [Probably not as effective]
   - Use a resume 'code' to store user data?
   - Probably a JS 'Quiz' framerwork we can use.
   - Tom urged to try things asap and learn from doing.
   - Early Implementation and testing is key.
- Organised to commit the Angular Dashboard, Design Choices directory and Meeting Log (Obviously).

Meeting 12.03.2021

Log:
- Agreed on role split, but also agreed that roles can be flexible as most are keen to try a bit of everything.
   - JP, DD and HS on front end
   - NT and VG on back end
- Agreed targets for next sprint

Actions:
- NT and VG to begin to mock up a DB design in excel
- JP and DD to look into appropriate JS quiz frameworks
- HS to format and organise GitHub page and some market research
   
Meeting log 18.03.2021

-> discussed progress in separate group tasks, i.e, backend and front end development stages (see corresponding meeting logs for individual meetings) -> dicussed scoping / evaluationg methods to maintian consistent work flow and effective project outcome visualisation -> booked a meeting with TAs (Allison / Marceli) in Easter break for feedback on our project -> constructed a notebook for documenting scope / further evaluation ideas, see scoping discussion document

Actions for next meeting: -> further develop respective parts of the application - back end and front end -> get feedback on respective parts of the application from those working in a different part of the application (ie front end team look at back end and vice versa) to allow everyone to be on the same page, and provide constructive feedback.
