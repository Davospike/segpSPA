#### 1.1 The Field 

There has been a rise in disinformation from many sources in the internet, from indiduals over social media sites, to high-profile news outlets. 

Major global events seem to be surrounded by fake news; for example, Brexit, The US Election (2020), Coronavirus and many others. Fake news is starting to spread in different forms also. One recent example is the DeepFake video that went viral of Queen Elizabeth. Within deepfake, speech and actions of celebrities are manipulated using static artificial intellegent-generated faces [^1].

Aside from the comical effects DeepFake may bring, fake news generally is a serious topic. Researchers at Oxford Internet Institute said the infosphere, *the online environment people are exposed to daily*, should. be considered "a social determinant of health" [^2]. Disinformation about Coronavirus related vaccines is a prime current example. Enough disinformation can significantly sway health decisions for individuals, exacerbating the current pandemic. The extreme consequences of fake news can be death. 

Aside from health consequences, fake news can leave irreversible damage to a company's reputations. For financial institutions, such as banks, fake news can detriment a company's health. In May 2019, Metro Bank's share price fell 11 percent due to false rumours claiming that the bank was on the brink of collapse, and urged customers to withdraw their funds [^3]. A 2019 survey conducted by Kroll showed results that suggested 84% of companies felt threatened about disinformation on social media platforms [^3].

There is a clear need for the information filtration systems within social media platforms, and across search engines. Over generations, if we do not see more effective filtration systems implemented, we can expect these detrimental effects of fake news to rise exponentially, as 'true news' becomes overshadowed, and people no longer have the skill to pick out the truth from a bunch of lies.

- this website has a feature in which you are asked about facts on specific topics
- nice layout, clear topic categorisation 
- have a progress tracker with stars, improves user retention and repeat visits on the website 
- after each question you get wrong, link to see the answer / description of the question 
- although supports our goal of educating users, no clear focus on fake news, just general misconceptionts people have about current global topics





<u>What we can take from this</u>

- overall, quiz source 3 : gapminder, seems to be the most attractive, and suited to our paper prototype, also it is designed as if to be a SPA - quick traversal across questions
- however, with respect to the backend of our project, we will use data similar to questions asked in the first 2 quizzes above. these questions support our aim on educating users to be clear on spotting fake news, understanding topics amongst the midst of disinformation, and overall dampening the effects of fake news spreaders. Gapminder's content is too general, and on topics that are not under the spotlight for being prone to fake news
