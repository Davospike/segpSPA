Feedback from Marceli and Allison on our paper prototype.

-Process folder is what should be in main, a big breakdown of stuff
-Per folder there needs to be Readme.md's that point the user in certain directions.
-Introductory section with background info.

-Can set up a Wiki on github, which is more structured than just a bunch of files.
 -> homepage for contents etc
 -> each page would have their own files and readmes

-Documentation is quite similar to The_process.
-Praise for gant chart.

-User feedback:
 	->Could use a system to track where users click and how long they spend on a page
	->could be possible to use a free system for this, or google analytics

-Sort out the layout of the repo sooner rather than later.
