        <p class="card-text">Brexit, eh. That really dragged on, didn't it? After a lot of to and fro, delays, buses and more, the UK eventually left the bloc. For good or for worse? Who knows. Over what felt like a lifetime, there was a lot of misinformation surrounding Brexit; can you distinguish between what was true, and what isn't?</p>

As well as ruining the Euros, COVID-19 was a catalyst for increased gaslighting and caused divisions between the inhabitants of earth due to a fair share of fake news and downright outrageous claims. But, can you tell what's what?</p>

What we do know, however, is that climate change is most certainly real (looking at you, Donald), and it is going to spoil the party if we, as a planet, are not careful with our actions. Misinformation is rife, with many senior folk not accepting the facts and plenty of interesting characters sharing interesting "news"...</p>

Unsurprisingly, as a huge contender to many western nations, it is going to be under the microscope quite often. As Donald's favourite trade war enemy, there is bound to be plenty of dubious articles surrounding the great nation. Try your luck and see if you can spot the baloney.</p>
