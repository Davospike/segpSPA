Serious

1. Bar chart (much like this one that shifts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og847HVwRSI) that shows the 
   number of fast food venues over time in the UK and then along side it or in another tab have a graph 
   or some sort of visualisation showing the increasing obesity rates across the UK. Could also extend 
   it to the entire world and have a globe (like https://www.covidvisualizer.com) and when the user clicks
   on it they can see a similar chart & graph set up. 
   Could also take "inspiration" from https://www.gapminder.org/ and have the user answer questions before 
   they see the chart and like Vini said, compare their answers against the truth. 

   Problem: rising obesity

2. Again with obesity / fast food: Could make an interactive menu for people containing the most popular fast
   food place's meals, but instead of just showing the food along with a list of ingredients and macros, they're
   invited to click the picture of the food (or some sprite representing the meal) and the sprite (guess it would
   work best with a burger because the animation of it splitting up into its components would look decent) separates
   not into flour, water, egg or whatever, but into the amount of fat, sugar, salt, whatever other rubbish that's in them.
   Any graphics would have to quite cartoony just so it wasn't so disgusting.
   Again ask questions, compare with reality. 

   Could combine 1 & 2. 

   Problem: rising obesity

3. Could have a map of the USA and track the progression of the 2020 / 21 civil unrest (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_United_States_racial_unrest) 
   that (I think) began with Ahmaud Arbery. There'd be a timeline that would automatically move on and with each event 
   a new pin or something would appear on the map with "Name of event, date" and a snippet of information underneath. 

   Actual data may be difficult with this: I don't know what kind of data you could display

   Problem: racism in the US 

4. This could be extremely difficult to map out but could be cool: visualise the loss of the rainforest / forest areas in general. 
   Again have a timeline and as it goes through the years you can see the forest recede. 

   Problem: habitat & biodiversity loss

5. The growth of wind power over the years. Could create a bar chart showing the most common form of energy used by
   different countries and how its changed for the world and individual states over time. 

   Problem: fossil fuels, climate change, clean energy

6. Bit of a dark one, sorry: suicide rates, got a CSV in 'Mental Health' that shows the number of suicides in different
   countries, separated by male/female and age group, between 1979-2016. Could look at the highest suicide rate by 
   population and see if that's changed. Which gender / age is more likely to commit suicide. 

   Problem: Mental Health

Everyday Life

1. 

Not Serious
-----------
1. The best bagel/sandwich/panini to have based on the temperature outside and your star sign:
   Whilst an important issue, may be difficult to get the data unless we get a survey out to 
   facebook mums

2. Trump Tweets:
   Bit overdone but still good. Could attempt to visualise his tweets or speeches, what the most common 
   phrases/words are, the time he tweeted etc. https://www.thetrumparchive.com contains all his tweets	
   The folder 'Trump' has a transcript of all his speeches & a .csv file of all the insults he threw 
   out on twitter 2015-2021. Could be good to see who was insulted most and the most common insult.

   We could also compare it with Obama's tweets between 2012-2019, look at how they differ in terms of 
   number of tweets, length of tweet. If we could analyse the words used in the tweets we could pass it 
   into some program that tells us the average reading age and see if that goes somewhere. Harvard CS50
   have a "Readability" exercise in which people create the program that determines reading age based on 
   text here - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/readability and it's in C.

   I've put the Obama CSV in the 'Trump' folder because I don't think we'd use it as a standalone dataset. 

   Transcript from: https://www.kaggle.com/arnavsharmaas/all-donald-trump-transcripts
   Trump CSV from: https://www.kaggle.com/ayushggarg/all-trumps-twitter-insults-20152021 
   Obama CSV from: https://www.kaggle.com/datacrux/barack-obama-twitterdata-from-20122019

3. Visualise which states Parler users came from:
   Created 'Parler' folder and added a CSV file that contains geotagged metadata which (I believe) shows 
   the time and location of where users captured video on their phones

4. Something to do with reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets:
   Created 'WSB' folder with a CSV file that has 29500 posts on the subreddit up to 28.1.21. Could look 
   again at most common word, most common stock, the time they post, whatever. 

   CSV from: https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/reddit-wallstreetsbets-posts

5. Spotify: 
   Got a CSV file in the folder 'Spotify' that has 160K songs from 1920-2020 that can be filtered in a 
   number of ways. I don't know how but someone has applied different ratings, such as "acousticness" 
   & "danceability", so we could look at how these ratings, if at all, have changed over the years. 
   Has music increased in "danceability" or has the duration of songs changed. 
   
   CSV from: https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks

6. Netflix: 
   CSV in "Netflix" folder which shows the number of tv shows / movies on netflix, the date added, date 
   produced, rating of it, duration etc. 
   
   CSV from: https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows

7. The best dish to buy from an Indian takeaway based on the date and time:
   Got a CSV in 'Takeaway' that has 33k orders from two Indian takeaways in London, with the date & time, the 
   item & quantity ordered and price. So we could just get all the timestamp data and see which is the most
   popular item at a specific time and tell people "If it's this day in this month and this time, this is what
   you need to buy". 

   CSV from: https://www.kaggle.com/henslersoftware/19560-indian-takeaway-orders

8. Airplane Crashes: 
   CSV in 'Plane', shows crashes and fatalities between 1908-2019. We could go show what kind of plane has had 
   the most crashes, the most dangerous year/month/place to fly in, the airline with the most deaths. 
   Data can be filtered to include just military, cargo, or passenger. 

   CSV from: https://www.kaggle.com/cgurkan/airplane-crash-data-since-1908
